        <h3>About our game</h3>
        
        <p>Our game is simple. We show you a statement and you tell us if it's true or false before time runs out. If you chose right, you get a point. Wrong, and you lose a heart. Run out of hearts, and it's game over. To make you lose more quickly, time decreases as you rack up points.</p>
        
        <p>In multiplayer mode, you can play with and against your friends and acquaintances. Since we know making group decisions takes more time, we let you choose how much time you get in team mode.</p>
        
        <p>Presently, our game consistents of over 500 questions spanning the political spectrum. We cover presidential candidates, laws that impact you and issues at the forefront of political discourse. We draw a wide range of sources for our statements in hopes of keeping our game politically neutral.</p>
